Hockey Shot Prediction and Visualization (2024 Season)

This project analyzes NHL shot data to explore patterns and predict goal probabilities using logistic regression. The dataset, obtained from MoneyPuck, includes all recorded shots from the 2024 season.
The workflow involves:
Data Collection: Automatically downloading and caching season shot data.
Visualization: Building rink scatterplots and heatmaps to visualize both actual and predicted shot outcomes.
Modeling: Training a logistic regression model using shot coordinates (xCordAdjusted, yCordAdjusted) to predict the likelihood of a goal.

After training, the model achieved:
Accuracy: 0.5425
AUC: 0.6522
Coefficients: [0.0284 (x-position), -0.00083 (y-position)]

These results suggest that shot distance from the net (x-coordinate) plays a stronger role in predicting goals than the lateral position (y-coordinate). The generated heatmap and shot plot illustrate regions of higher predicted goal probabilities across the rink surface.
Limitations:
While the model provides a useful visualization of goal likelihood by location, it is constrained by the simplicity of its feature set. Real-world goal probability depends on many additional factors — such as shot type, game situation, player skill, defensive pressure, and goalie position — which are not captured here. As a result, the predictions should be viewed as a basic spatial probability model rather than a fully comprehensive performance predictor.
